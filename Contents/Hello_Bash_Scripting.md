## What is bash?

\- Bash (AKA Bourne Again Shell) is a type of interpreter that processes shell commands. 

\- A shell interpreter takes commands in plain text format and calls Operating System services to do something.

\- Every shell script starts with a **shebang**. The term shebang refers to the "#!" located at the top of many script files that point to the associated program's path.

\- In this tutorial, we will be using bash shell. for example `#! /bin/bash`.

\- This line instructs the operating system running the shell script on where the executable for shell and its associated files are located

### Example :
```shell
#! /bin/bash

echo "Hello world"

```
### Output :
```
~$ sh helloworld.sh

Hello world
```
